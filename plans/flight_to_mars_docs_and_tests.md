## üîç Analysis & Investigation

### Codebase Structure
The PhysicsLabs project consists of multiple interactive physics labs, with two main labs currently implemented:
1. `throw_a_rock` - Projectile motion with air resistance
2. `flight_to_mars` - Multi-stage space flight simulation

### Current Architecture
The Flight to Mars lab is structured into multiple flight stages:
- **Earth**: Rocket launch from Earth with adjustable parameters (mass, fuel ratio, acceleration)
- **Space**: Interplanetary travel between Earth and Mars orbits
- **Mars**: Landing on Mars with reverse-engineering of the takeoff sequence

The lab uses physics constants like gravitational constant (G), planet masses, radii, and orbital parameters.

### Dependencies & Integration Points
- Uses shared models from `labs.model` (Vector2D, constants)
- Uses Streamlit for UI components
- Uses Plotly for visualizations
- Uses shared visualization utilities

### Considerations & Challenges
The Flight to Mars lab has three distinct stages with different physics calculations:
1. Earth launch: Uses rocket equation with fixed acceleration or fuel rate
2. Interplanetary travel: Uses orbital mechanics around the Sun
3. Mars landing: Reverse-engineered trajectory with landing requirements

The tests need to verify both computational accuracy and physical common-sense expectations.

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
- Understand the three flight stages and their physics parameters
- Analyze existing `throw_a_rock` test patterns for structure consistency
- Familiarize with physics equations used in the simulation

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Create Flight to Mars Lab README**
   - Files to modify: `labs/flight_to_mars/README.md`
   - Changes needed: Create comprehensive README following the structure of throw_a_rock README with sections for problem description, input parameters, team, launch instructions and links to tests

2. **Create Test README with Calculations**
   - Files to modify: `tests/flight_to_mars/README.md`
   - Changes needed: Create detailed physics calculations for each flight stage with expected values for verification

3. **Implement Physics-Based Tests for Earth Stage**
   - Files to modify: `tests/flight_to_mars/test_earth_stage.py`
   - Changes needed: Tests that verify rocket escape velocity calculations and fuel consumption models

4. **Implement Physics-Based Tests for Space Stage**
   - Files to modify: `tests/flight_to_mars/test_space_stage.py`
   - Changes needed: Tests that verify orbital mechanics and interplanetary travel calculations

5. **Implement Physics-Based Tests for Mars Stage**
   - Files to modify: `tests/flight_to_mars/test_mars_stage.py`
   - Changes needed: Tests that verify Mars landing parameters and fuel requirements

6. **Implement Common-Sense Validation Tests**
   - Files to modify: `tests/flight_to_mars/test_common_sense.py`
   - Changes needed: At least 5 tests checking physical expectations like "higher acceleration leads to faster orbit escape"

7. **Update Root README**
   - Files to modify: `README.md`
   - Changes needed: Add link to the new flight_to_mars test documentation

### Testing Strategy
The tests will have two types as required:
1. **Calculation-based tests**: Verify simulation accuracy against known physics equations with expected values in the README
2. **Common-sense tests**: Validate physical relationships like "higher acceleration should result in shorter flight times"

## üéØ Success Criteria
- All tests pass with meaningful test data based on real physics equations
- Common-sense validation tests correctly identify expected physical relationships
- Documentation is comprehensive and follows the same structure as existing labs
- Root README is updated with appropriate links to the new documentation
